# ComRAT-C

comRAT-C is a test to evaluate human's creativity by the ability of finding a fourth word which is forming a compound word with 3 given words. 
In context of my university course [User Centric Design](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/inf/groups/hcc/teaching/summer_term_2019/user-centered-design.html), we were asked to visualize the [data](https://hackmd.io/@sDEVZhpAQ-qtvwVu36BtZA/HJlaHleyB#First-example-with-%E2%80%98cheese%E2%80%99) of the comRAT-C AI, created in a [research project](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331938777_Cognitive_AI_Systems_Contribute_to_Improving_Creativity_Modeling_and_Measuring_Tools) at my universty "Free University of Berlin".
